1. infect.c reads target.exe to generate an infected-target.exe
2. infected-target.exe will have a trikcy jump and virus payload
3. infected-target.exe should be of size 7328 bytes

notes:
when virus code executes ret it pops the original return address.
need to read the binary w/ readelf in order to know where in the binary to edit.
since you are statically editing not trying to infect at run-time.
